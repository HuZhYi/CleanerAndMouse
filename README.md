# Folding-Beijing

18th Nov 2017, 19 people lived in an industrial neighborhood in south Beijing was killed in a fire accident. The migrants workers eviction were accelerated by this event. Beijing government launched an action called ”Inspection, eviction and regulation” in the name of improving fire protection. 

By 26th Nov 2017, city regulators need to evict tons of thousands what they called “Low quality population”, the residents who live here, need to do whatever they can, to protect themselves from being evicting. 
Stay or leave? This is a war without winner.

2017年11月18日，北京大兴县新建村聚福缘公寓起火，19人不幸丧生；火灾加速了城市管理者对外来人口的清理速度，以新建村为起点，北京全市展开了以消防安全为重点的安全隐患“大排查、大清理、大整治”行动。
城市管理者需要在2017年11月26日前，全面清走这些“低端人口”；而住在这里的居民，需要保住自己在这个陌生城市中，临时逼仄的家。
留下还是被驱逐？这是一场没有胜者的战役。
